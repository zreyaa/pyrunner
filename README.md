please don't download it thanks

Q&A:

Q: Is this a joke?
A: Yes, it definitly is.

Q: Where is the game?
A: If there are no downloads in 'Releases', I probably abandoned this page so get something better to do with your time.

Q: Is this a virus?
A: You have my word for it, I don't have a clue how to code malware in Python but don't download .exe files from the internet anyway.
